# AVR_NOKIA5110
NOKIA5110 Library for AVR + Example code

ATmega328p MCU was used for example. 
You may need to modify SPI features to use this libary for other AVR MCUs.

I've downloaded LCD5110_Graph library for arduino and modified codes to make it run on Atmel Studio 7.
Some of functions are modified at my convenience.
